# Stationary Thermal Analysis Problem

To make a 2D finite elements program using python which can solve stationary thermal analysis problem with the following main features.
• 2D Domain
• The elements are 4 nodes bi-linear quadrangular elements formulated in the physical space.
• Isotropic Conductivity is assumed.
• Homogeneous Boundary conditions are only considered. (zero Dirichlet boundary conditions)
